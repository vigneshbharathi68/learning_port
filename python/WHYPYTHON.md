## Is Python Useful?
- Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it a great choice for beginners and experts alike. Python’s readability makes it a great first programming language — it allows you to think like a programmer and not waste time with confusing syntax. For instance, look at the following code to print “hello world” in Java and Python.
JAVA

    public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world");
    }
    }


PYTHON 

    print("hello world)    


Installation

- And now you’ve run your first Python program as easy as that! If Python isn’t installed, it’s easy to [download and install](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Instead of focusing on how to get your code to even run, you’ll be able to focus on learning actual programming concepts. And once you have those tools under your belt, if you move on to other languages, you’ll be able to easily understand a given piece of code.

- The [Dropbox desktop](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/30/python-community-and-python-at-dropbox) client is written entirely in Python, which speaks to its cross-platform compatibility. Dropbox has about 400 million users and considering it isn’t bundled with any operating system distribution, that’s a lot of users downloading and installing Dropbox. In addition to their desktop client, Dropbox’s server-side code is in Python as well, making it the majority language used at the company.

- Google uses a mix of languages, with C++, Python, and now Go among them. Early on at Google, there was an [engineering decision](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2560310/heavy-usage-of-python-at-google/2561008#2561008) to use “Python where we can, C++ where we must.” Python was used for parts that required rapid delivery and maintenance. Then, they used C++ for the parts of the software stack where it was important to have very low latency and/or tight control of memory.  
- There are lots of great reasons to [learn Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python), and hopefully a few of the examples and resources I’ve shown today have helped you see how you could be using it too.
